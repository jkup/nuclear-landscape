## üéØ What is the Nuclear Landscape?

The nuclear landscape (or Chart of Nuclides) is a fundamental tool in nuclear physics that plots all known atomic nuclei:

- **X-axis (Neutrons)**: Number of neutrons (N) in the nucleus
- **Y-axis (Protons)**: Number of protons (Z) in the nucleus
- **Colors**: Represent different nuclear properties like stability, decay modes, or half-lives

This visualization reveals fascinating patterns:

- The "valley of stability" where stable nuclei reside
- Magic numbers (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) showing enhanced nuclear stability
- The drip lines where nuclei become unbound
- Islands of stability predicted for superheavy elements

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### Magic Numbers

Magic numbers in nuclear physics are specific numbers of protons or neutrons that result in enhanced nuclear stability:

- **Protons**: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 114 (predicted)
- **Neutrons**: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, 184 (predicted)

### Decay Modes

- **Alpha (Œ±)**: Emission of helium-4 nucleus
- **Beta Minus (Œ≤‚Åª)**: Neutron converts to proton + electron + antineutrino
- **Beta Plus (Œ≤‚Å∫)**: Proton converts to neutron + positron + neutrino
- **Electron Capture (EC)**: Nucleus captures an inner electron
- **Spontaneous Fission (SF)**: Heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei
